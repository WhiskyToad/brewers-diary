Brewers Diary

This is a MERN fullstack project to create a logbook for recording homebrew recipes and brew logs. Eventually I want to expand it into a recipe based social media site. It
is full stack React and Node, using axios and redux in the front end and express and MongoDB at the backend. I have been using Chakra UI to style.

So far it has full CRUD functionality for adding recipes, the priority todo list currently looks like:

rate recipe <br>
