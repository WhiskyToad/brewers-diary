# <p align="center">Introduction </p>

After completing tutorials for both React and Node I finally moved on to something I wanted to build! Having dabbled in home brewing and wanting
to keep my notes organized and have a place for finding recipes and sharing I decided to create it. I found a tutorial on the MERN stack since I
just needed to information on how to put all my new found skills together into a single project. With some tweaking and researching I was able to pull it off
and it looks nothing like the tutorial I was following for a basic social media post website.

## <p align="center">Front-End

### <p align="center">React

I wanted to continue expanding my knowledge in this area and have a good project to showcase for it.

### <p align="center">Chakra UI

The tutorial I was following used Material UI, I had heard about Chakra and done a little bit of research before deciding to differ from the tutorial and use Chakra.

### <p align="center">Redux

I used it a few times before this and it was what was in the tutorial and I also had no real experience or knowledge of the other options at this point and so I continued down the Redux path.

### <p align="center">React Google Login

Very simple to use package for providing google log in. I use google log in a lot and so it made sense to include it.

### <p align="center">Browser Image Compression

To convert my images and keep them of a manageable size

### <p align="center">React Rating Stars Component

A very cool package providing a rating system, very simple to use and you can customize it easily to suit your needs. The tutorial had a like system and so I branched out myself to create a star rating system instead as that was more fitting to my needs.

### <p align="center">GraphQL (development)

This isn't actually in my live project, but I wanted to learn it and so I gave refactoring my project a go. Very difficult to start with since I was using Redux and there is little to no information on how to combine the two, eventually I switched to Apollo to try and fix a few issues. Whilst I will probably never switch the live project to GraphQL it was an excellent way to learn, very challenging, but it gave me a better understanding than by just following tutorial projects. Currently it is in the develop branch but I will eventually switch it onto a GraphQL branch when I come back to develop this further, just so it can live on for me to reference in future projects.

## <p align="center">Back-End

### <p align="center">Node

I had just finished a few tutorials and had enough confidence to build something out with Node. Very quick and easy to use.

### <p align="center">Express

At what point should Express just be considered part of working with Node?

### <p align="center">Bcrypt

For encrypting passwords

### <p align="center">MongoDB

Very popular and again something I wanted to learn for that reason.
